# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oleksandra Matyah and this is my test case for technical writer position for [documentat.io](https://documentat.io/)

During the test task:

+ I got acquainted with the basic information about the web servers **Apache** and **nginx**;
+ I studied how the Let's Encrypt CA works, in particular the process of obtaining free SSL certificates;
+ I found out how paid and free SSL certificates differ, studied their pros and cons;
+ I learned the Markdown language;
+ I used the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate html with guides.

Both guides about obtaining free SSL-certificates from **Let's encrypt** for [documentat.io](https://documentat.io/) which based on **Apache** and **ngnix** are written in English and Russian.

Have a nice day! ðŸ™‚
